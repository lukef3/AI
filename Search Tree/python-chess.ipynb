    "## Board Evaluation\n",
    "\n",
    "Since a chess game tree becomes exponentially large due to the number of possible moves, a maximum depth is set for the tree. To assign a value to these nodes at maximum depth, an evaluation function is needed to evaluate how good or bad each player is doing.\n",
    "\n",
    "The evaluate board function for chess is simple enough - add up the values of the player's pieces and the opponent's pieces, and return the difference. This is generally a good indicator of who is at an advantage, but not always. Piece positions are just as if not more important than the value of the pieces on the board, so additional logic was added for the king-pawn-king endgame scenario.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function first checks if the game has ended, returning very large positive values for a win, and very large negative values for a loss, with 0 for a draw.\n",
    "\n",
    "The score of the board is then calculated by adding up the values of all the white pieces and the black pieces, and returning the difference.\n",
    "\n",
    "The function was subsequently expanded to provide a better evaluation when there are only kings and pawns left on the board. Certain modifiers are used to change the score in order to influence move choice.\n",
    "\n",
    "The following rewards/penalties were added (attacker is side with pawn, defender is side without pawn:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. Reward pawns moving closer to promotion - (for white, increasing the score if its square rank is closer to 8, opposite for black)\n",
    "2. Reward the king being close to its pawn. The king should support and protect its pawn as pawn promotion is needed to win. (king score is penalised for moving away from its pawn)\n",
    "3. Opposition - a reward is given to the attacker if it is closer to the promotion square than the defender. The attacker is at an advantage if it has more control over the path to promotion than the defender.\n",
    "4. Attacker is rewarded the further away the defender is from its pawn.\n",
    "\n",
    "These reward values need to be adjusted for optimal performance in the endgame scenario.\n"
